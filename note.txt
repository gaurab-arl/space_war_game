planning to implement:

Two enemy types: one moving left to right while firing bullets, and another spawning and moving downward
Random bullets appearing across the screen
A health system where the spaceship has 3 HP before game over
A reward system with coins appearing during gameplay

Create sprite classes for your player ship, enemies, bullets, and coins
Implement the movement patterns you described
Add collision detection for bullets, enemies, and coins
Create a health system with visual indicators
Add a scoring/coin collection system

-> Explanation
extern in userui.h tells the compiler that these variables exist somewhere but are defined in another file.
int x, y; and User_name user; are actually defined in userui.cpp, so there are no duplicate definitions.

-> setcolor(WHITE);
    rectangle(40, 30, 140, 70);
    setfillstyle(SOLID_FILL, BLACK);
    bar(41, 31, 139, 69);
    when using baar first x , y coordinatae should be higher coordinate 
      
-> bar is a type of recatngle filled with color , rectangle may not be used if we does not need outline with different color

      
->   while (!kbhit()) {                                        // until key is hit it runs
        if (ismouseclick(WM_LBUTTONDOWN)) { 
            getmouseclick(WM_LBUTTONDOWN, x, y);
            printf("%d \t %d \n ", x, y);                     // Print coordinates
        }
    }
